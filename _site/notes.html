        <h3><a href="/notes/2013/01/11/emmett.html">Emmett</a></h3>
        <p>I’ve always loved ZenCoding, but when I heard they were changing it and giving it a new name, I was immediately skeptical. How could they make it any better? Emmett is ZenCoding on steroids. Yes, it has a new name, but it is greater in just about every way.</p>

<p>Take for a moment the following line:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">html&gt;head&gt;title+link+script^body&gt;header&gt;h1&gt;a^^#content&gt;h2^footer
</code></pre></div>


<p>With Emmett installed, all I have to do is hit tab and it expands into this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html">  <span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;header&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/header&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Once it’s expanded, I can tab around and it will drop me inside of the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag, tab again and it’ll put me inside of the href attribute for the stylesheet, etc.</p>

<p>Ever been stuck here?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;/images/foo.png&quot;</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;???&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Or maybe even here?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="nc">.elementWithBackgroundImage</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">background</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="sx">url(/images/foo.png)</span> <span class="k">no-repeat</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">???</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>We probably all have. So what do we do? We leave the context of our editor, we bounce out to the finder, find the file, and inspect the file to grab the image dimensions. This is not rocket science, but it breaks us from the task at hand and slows us down. Weak sauce.</p>

<p>Emmett helps us out here by offering a simple keyboard shortcut that when envoked, will look up the path/to/image, find it’s dimensions, and complete our tag or CSS for us. Amazing.</p>

<p>Tools like this make writing html fun again.</p>

<p>Emmett can do a bunch of other tasks that simplify front-end development. I urge you to check out the <a href="http://docs.emmet.io">videos</a>, and see what it can do for you.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://drewwilson.com/">Drew Wilson</a> launched a sneak peak of the future of his social network, <a href="http://dialog.gs">Dialoggs</a>.</p>

<p>Dialoggs launched in late October as a great place to have lengthy conversations with others in public (or private). I've always thought of it as Twitter, but without the pesky character limit. In a recent <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/35-drew">interview</a>, Drew announced that Dialoggs was headed in another direction, and the future of Dialoggs would be video.</p>

<p>You can view a demo now by pulling up <a href="http://call.dialog.gs">http://call.dialog.gs</a> in Chrome. The demo is a minimal, light-weight video chat app that transmits video via <a href="http://www.tokbox.com/">TokBox</a> and text via <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>. I've used other video-conferencing software before — often times at great expense to my company — but there's nothing that works as easily and seamlessly as this.</p>

<p>This is a prime example of the potential of the web, and it's great to be able to play with it today. Check it out for free at <a href="http://call.dialog.gs">http://call.dialog.gs</a>.</p>

<p>Well, it happened. Marco Arment's <em>Build and Analyze</em>, ended last Friday. It feels odd to already miss it, but I do. The show quickly became a weekly ritual that I looked forward to during my hour-long commute into the city. All good things come to an end though, and I couldn't be happier for Marco and all the things that lie ahead.</p>

        <h3><a href="/notes/2012/12/14/the-best-tablet.html">The Best Tablet</a></h3>
        <p>I sold my 32GB 4G Retina iPad3 to get my hands on a lesser-equipped, non-retina 16GB iPad mini.</p>

<p>Why? The form factor.</p>

<p>This is not a gimmick to sell more devices. This is an infinitely better device. One that I've found to be a hell of a lot more practical.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the weight of the 10", maybe it was the fact that I spent 2X on it, but I just wasn't comfortable taking it with me. What's the best camera? The one you'll always carry around. The same goes for tablets. I use thing everywhere: trains, busses, work -- I even use this thing walking OUTSIDE IN THE ELEMENTS.</p>

<p>If you're in the market for a tablet, you may be swayed by the Retina screen or 2X speeds of the new iPad4. Given my experience with iPads though, I'd urge you to consider how the Mini might work better for you.</p>

        <p>I won't lie, I plan to spend my hard-earned money on this.</p>

<p>I hope it delivers on a few fronts:</p>

<ol>
<li>A native-feeling app. Sparrow was great, but it never seemed to Push emails to me like Mail.app would. GMail2 is great too, but it's really difficult to switch accounts and see where exactly that unread message lives. I want an app that can out-perform Mail.app on features and speed.</li>
<li>Email as a task management solution. I've tried/purchased just about every task app that I could since the iPhone dropped - it's the promise of an organized life. I use Clear for quick honey-do lists, Things for stuff at work and day to day tasks, Due for time-sensitive do-this-now tasks, Checkmark for location-based tasks, and Reminders for shared lists with the wife ( I recognize that I have a problem ). Please let this be the app that gets these others off my phone and out of my mind.</li>
</ol>

        <h3><a href="/notes/2012/12/11/why-i-love-github-flow.html">Why I Love GitHub Flow</a></h3>
        <p>It's funny to think that one article has entirely changed how I want to work moving forward, but Scott Chacon's <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">GitHub Flow</a> has done just that.</p>

<p>A co-worker, <a href="http://toddjlarsen.com/">Todd Larsen</a>, suggested that our team consider it when we formed earlier this fall. Luckily for us, we made the right decision.</p>

<p>The main precepts are deceptively simple <em>(my steps slightly differ from Scott's, but the idea is the same)</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Our <code>master</code> branch in Git is always deployable.</li>
<li>Whenever we begin new work, we create a branch (use a very specific name <code>animate-gift-finder-on-init</code> for example) that tracks <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>We push up this branch to GitHub, and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">turn it into a Pull Request</a>.</li>
<li>We push updates to this branch early and often getting code critiques as we go. (GitHub's interface for this is amazing — we can <a href="https://github.com/blog/785-pull-request-diff-comments">make comments in the code</a>). When it's ready to be merged into <code>master</code>, we simply ask others to give it a final review, and share their thoughts in the comments.</li>
<li>Once people have reviewed and signed off on the feature, it can be merged into <code>master</code> right through <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request">GitHub's interface</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>It seems almost obvious; a logical progression of the tools a lot of us use everyday. It has had a profound impact in the way we feel about our work and the way we work together. Here are three benefits I've noticed:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>It improved communication.</strong> Because we post code early in the process, the team can literally see how others think through problems. If you like what you see, tell them specifically (ie: "Great use of variables here!"). When you see something that can be improved, share that too (ie: "Let's refactor this section, and make it a module to be used everywhere.").</li>
<li><strong>It improved communication, part 2.</strong> Despite our development staff living in two different cities with time zone differences, we were never kept out of the loop. This is largely because all of our communication was had out in the open — in the code — via Pull Requests.</li>
<li><strong>Overall developer happiness.</strong> For the first time in my professional life, I felt like the code my teammates and I were producing was a joint effort, and I was able to see how every line was assembled along the way.</li>
</ol>


<p>I'm sure there are situations where this breaks down or doesn't work for everyone, but it's helped change the way that I think about going to work in the morning. I encourage everyone to look into how it might benefit your workflow.</p>

        <h3><a href="/notes/2012/11/28/git-chipper.html">Git Chipper</a></h3>
        <p>On Mondays, after downing a large cup of coffee, I try to ease back into the saddle by getting my environment back into proper working order. I'll get my windows organized the way I like them, run database migrations, pull down my repo updates, and invariably I'll find myself deleting 20+ local branches from the previous iteration. Occasionally there's a branch or two that I'll carry into the next week, but more often than not, I just want to blow away everything.</p>

<p>Up until now, I'd clench my jaw, put my head down and type out <code>git branch -D</code> a bunch of times. Don't get me wrong - <strong>this is not difficult</strong>, it's just needlessly repetitive. Inspired by helpful scripts like <a href="/notes/2012/11/26/git-fresh.html">git fresh</a>, I sought a better way to automate the process of branch removal. Now all I have to type is <code>git chipper</code>, a calm washes over me, and I can attack the day focused on shipping code.</p>

<p>All you need to do is place this file somewhere in your PATH, and make it executable. Then you can call it from any git repo. The process might look something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">    <span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/bin/
    <span class="nv">$ </span>chmod +x git-chipper
    <span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/sites/groupon/
    <span class="nv">$ </span>git chipper
</code></pre></div>

I thought I'd include it here to straighten out my perceived injustice.</p>

        <p>Have you ever typed in git branch and wondered what insane person created all these random local branches? If you're like me, then I'm sure you experience this all the time (especially after a few days off from work).</p>

<p>Luckily for both you and I, a friend and co-worker wrote up a quick script to make sense of the madness. It's called <a href="http://tristanblease.com/post/25489300287/git-fresh">Git Fresh</a> and it gives you insight into how <em>fresh</em> your local branches are by sorting them by the date you touched them last.</p>

<p>I find it most helpful when getting rid of old branches I no longer use, but it's also great for piecing together the thoughts of your former self — in that sense, it's kind of like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk"><em>enhance</em></a> in CSI.</p>

<p>I use this script <strong>every single day</strong>, and I think it just might help to improve your daily interactions with Git. Hit the link above, use it, and please let me know what you think.</p>
