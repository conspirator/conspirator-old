I won't lie, I plan to spend my hard-earned money on this.

I hope it delivers on a few fronts:

1. A native-feeling app. Sparrow was great, but it never seemed to Push emails to me like Mail.app would. GMail2 is great too, but it's really difficult to switch accounts and see where exactly that unread message lives. I want an app that can out-perform Mail.app on features and speed.
2. Email as a task management solution. I've tried/purchased just about every task app that I could since the iPhone dropped - it's the promise of an organized life. I use Clear for quick honey-do lists, Things for stuff at work and day to day tasks, Due for time-sensitive do-this-now tasks, Checkmark for location-based tasks, and Reminders for shared lists with the wife ( I recognize that I have a problem ). Please let this be the app that gets these others off my phone and out of my mind.

Here's hoping. Check it out at [http://mailboxapp.com](http://mailboxapp.com).
