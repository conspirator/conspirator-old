Well, it happened. Marco Arment's *Build and Analyze*, ended last Friday. It feels odd to already miss it, but I do. The show quickly became a weekly ritual that I looked forward to during my hour-long commute into the city. All good things come to an end though, and I couldn't be happier for Marco and all the things that lie ahead.
