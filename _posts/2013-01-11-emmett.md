I’ve always loved ZenCoding, but when I heard they were changing it and giving it a new name, I was immediately skeptical. How could they make it any better? Emmett is ZenCoding on steroids. Yes, it has a new name, but it is greater in just about every way.

Take for a moment the following line:

{% highlight text %}
html>head>title+link+script^body>header>h1>a^^#content>h2^footer
{% endhighlight %}

With Emmett installed, all I have to do is hit tab and it expands into this:

{% highlight html %}
  <html>
    <head>
      <title></title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="">
      <script></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <header>
        <h1><a href=""></a></h1>
      </header>
      <div id="content">
        <h2></h2>
      </div>
      <footer></footer>
    </body>
  </html>
{% endhighlight %}

Once it’s expanded, I can tab around and it will drop me inside of the `<title>` tag, tab again and it’ll put me inside of the href attribute for the stylesheet, etc.

Ever been stuck here?

{% highlight html %}
<img src="/images/foo.png" width="???">
{% endhighlight %}

Or maybe even here?

{% highlight css %}
.elementWithBackgroundImage {
  background: url(/images/foo.png) no-repeat;
  display: block;
  width: ???;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We probably all have. So what do we do? We leave the context of our editor, we bounce out to the finder, find the file, and inspect the file to grab the image dimensions. This is not rocket science, but it breaks us from the task at hand and slows us down. Weak sauce.

Emmett helps us out here by offering a simple keyboard shortcut that when envoked, will look up the path/to/image, find it’s dimensions, and complete our tag or CSS for us. Amazing.

Tools like this make writing html fun again.

Emmett can do a bunch of other tasks that simplify front-end development. I urge you to check out the [videos](http://docs.emmet.io), and see what it can do for you.
