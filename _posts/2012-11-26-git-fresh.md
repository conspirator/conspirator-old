Have you ever typed in git branch and wondered what insane person created all these random local branches? If you're like me, then I'm sure you experience this all the time (especially after a few days off from work).

Luckily for both you and I, a friend and co-worker wrote up a quick script to make sense of the madness. It's called [Git Fresh](http://tristanblease.com/post/25489300287/git-fresh) and it gives you insight into how *fresh* your local branches are by sorting them by the date you touched them last.

I find it most helpful when getting rid of old branches I no longer use, but it's also great for piecing together the thoughts of your former self â€” in that sense, it's kind of like [*enhance*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk) in CSI.

I use this script **every single day**, and I think it just might help to improve your daily interactions with Git. Hit the link above, use it, and please let me know what you think.
