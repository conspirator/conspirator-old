A few weeks ago, [Drew Wilson](http://drewwilson.com/) launched a sneak peak of the future of his social network, [Dialoggs](http://dialog.gs).

Dialoggs launched in late October as a great place to have lengthy conversations with others in public (or private). I've always thought of it as Twitter, but without the pesky character limit. In a recent [interview](http://theeastwing.net/episodes/35-drew), Drew announced that Dialoggs was headed in another direction, and the future of Dialoggs would be video.

You can view a demo now by pulling up [http://call.dialog.gs](http://call.dialog.gs) in Chrome. The demo is a minimal, light-weight video chat app that transmits video via [TokBox](http://www.tokbox.com/) and text via [Pusher](http://pusher.com/). I've used other video-conferencing software before — often times at great expense to my company — but there's nothing that works as easily and seamlessly as this.

This is a prime example of the potential of the web, and it's great to be able to play with it today. Check it out for free at [http://call.dialog.gs](http://call.dialog.gs).
