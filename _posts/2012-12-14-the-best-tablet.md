I sold my 32GB 4G Retina iPad3 to get my hands on a lesser-equipped, non-retina 16GB iPad mini.

Why? The form factor.

This is not a gimmick to sell more devices. This is an infinitely better device. One that I've found to be a hell of a lot more practical.

Maybe it was the weight of the 10", maybe it was the fact that I spent 2X on it, but I just wasn't comfortable taking it with me. What's the best camera? The one you'll always carry around. The same goes for tablets. I use thing everywhere: trains, busses, work -- I even use this thing walking OUTSIDE IN THE ELEMENTS.

If you're in the market for a tablet, you may be swayed by the Retina screen or 2X speeds of the new iPad4. Given my experience with iPads though, I'd urge you to consider how the Mini might work better for you.
