I was recently going through some old [LittleSnapper](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/) screenshots from back in the day, and came across this guy. This had such a profound effect on me back then, and I still have trouble pulling my eyes away today. I **love** the geometric grid, the vibrant colors, and beautiful gradients. It's funny to think that this was done *three* years ago. Has there been a city since that's been able to rival Melbourne's modern, forward-thinking identity?
